  abstract = {The history of the development of statistical hypothesis testing in time series analysis
  is reviewed briefly and it is pointed out that the hypothesis testing procedure is not adequately
  defined as the procedure for statistical model identification. The classical maximum likelihood
  estimation procedure is reviewed and a new estimate minimum information theoretical criterion (AIC)
  estimate (MAICE) which is designed for the purpose of statistical identification is introduced. When
  there are several competing models the MAICE is defined by the model and the maximum likelihood
  estimates of the parameters which give the minimum of AIC defined by AIC = (-2)log-(maximum
  likelihood) + 2(number of independently adjusted parameters within the model). MAICE provides a
  versatile procedure for statistical model identification which is free from the ambiguities inherent
  in the application of conventional hypothesis testing procedure. The practical utility of MAICE in
  time series analysis is demonstrated with some numerical examples.},

  abstract = {The history of the development of statistical hypothesis testing in time series analysis
  is reviewed briefly and it is pointed out that the hypothesis testing procedure is not adequately
  defined as the procedure for statistical model identification. The classical maximum likelihood
  estimation procedure is reviewed and a new estimate minimum information theoretical criterion (AIC)
  estimate (MAICE) which is designed for the purpose of statistical identification is introduced. When
  there are several competing models the MAICE is defined by the model and the maximum likelihood
  estimates of the parameters which give the minimum of AIC defined by AIC = (-2)log-(maximum
  likelihood) + 2(number of independently adjusted parameters within the model). MAICE provides a
  versatile procedure for statistical model identification which is free from the ambiguities inherent
  in the application of conventional hypothesis testing procedure. The practical utility of MAICE in
  time series analysis is demonstrated with some numerical examples.},

@Inproceedings {export:80953,
abstract     = {<p>Data center infrastructures are highly underutilized on

                average. Typically, a data center manager computes the

                number of servers his facility can host by dividing the total

                power capacity of each rack by an assigned “peak power

                rating” for each server. However, this scheme suffers from

                the weakness of all static provisioning schemes – it does not

                account for the variability of load on the servers. We propose

                an algorithm that studies the power consumption behavior

                of the servers over time and suggests optimal ways

                to combine them in racks to maximize rack power utilization.

                Our algorithm – RackPacker – smooths aggregate rack

                power utilization by grouping together servers that are unlikely

                to peak together. Our evaluation of RackPacker on

                data from an MSN Messenger deployment shows substantially

                superior results than static packing.</p>},

    Abstract = {Sharing a MapReduce cluster between users is attractive because it enables statistical
    multiplexing (lowering costs) and allows users to share a common large data set. However, we find
    that traditional scheduling algorithms can perform very poorly in MapReduce due to two aspects of
    the MapReduce setting: the need for data locality (running computation where the data is) and the
    dependence between map and reduce tasks. We illustrate these problems through our experience
    designing a fair scheduler for MapReduce at Facebook, which runs a 600-node multi-user data
    warehouse on Hadoop. We developed two simple techniques, delay scheduling and copy-compute
    splitting, which improve throughput and response times by factors of 2 to 10. Although we focus on
    multi-user workloads, our techniques can also raise throughput in a single-user, FIFO workload by a
    factor of 2.}

    Abstract = {The past few years have seen a major change in computing systems, as growing data
    volumes and stalling processor speeds require more and more applications to scale out to distributed
    systems.  Today, a myriad data sources, from the Internet to business operations to scientific
    instruments, produce large and valuable data streams. However, the processing capabilities of single
    machines have not kept up with the size of data, making it harder and harder to put to use.  As a
    result, a growing number of organizations---not just web companies, but traditional enterprises and
    research labs---need to scale out their most important computations to clusters of hundreds of
    machines.

At the same time, the speed and sophistication required of data processing have grown.  In addition to
simple queries, complex algorithms like machine learning and graph analysis are becoming common in many
domains. And in addition to batch processing, streaming analysis of new real-time data sources is
required to let organizations take timely action.  Future computing platforms will need to not only
scale out traditional workloads, but support these new applications as well.

This dissertation proposes an architecture for cluster computing systems that can tackle emerging data
processing workloads while coping with larger and larger scales.  Whereas early cluster computing
systems, like MapReduce, handled batch processing, our architecture also enables streaming and
interactive queries, while keeping the scalability and fault tolerance of previous systems. And whereas
most deployed systems only support simple one-pass computations (e.g. aggregation or SQL queries), ours
also extends to the multi-pass algorithms required for more complex analytics (e.g. iterative algorithms
for machine learning).  Finally, unlike the specialized systems proposed for some of these workloads,
our architecture allows these computations to be combined, enabling rich new applications that intermix,
for example, streaming and batch processing, or SQL and complex analytics.

We achieve these results through a simple extension to MapReduce that adds primitives for data sharing,
called Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs).  We show that this is enough to efficiently capture a wide
range of workloads.  We implement RDDs in the open source Spark system, which we evaluate using both
synthetic benchmarks and real user applications.  Spark matches or exceeds the performance of
specialized systems in many application domains, while offering stronger fault tolerance guarantees and
allowing these workloads to be combined. We explore the generality of RDDs from both a theoretical
modeling perspective and a practical perspective to see why this extension can capture a wide range of
previously disparate workloads.}

  abstract = {The history of the development of statistical hypothesis testing in time series analysis
  is reviewed briefly and it is pointed out that the hypothesis testing procedure is not adequately
  defined as the procedure for statistical model identification. The classical maximum likelihood
  estimation procedure is reviewed and a new estimate minimum information theoretical criterion (AIC)
  estimate (MAICE) which is designed for the purpose of statistical identification is introduced. When
  there are several competing models the MAICE is defined by the model and the maximum likelihood
  estimates of the parameters which give the minimum of AIC defined by AIC = (-2)log-(maximum
  likelihood) + 2(number of independently adjusted parameters within the model). MAICE provides a
  versatile procedure for statistical model identification which is free from the ambiguities inherent
  in the application of conventional hypothesis testing procedure. The practical utility of MAICE in
  time series analysis is demonstrated with some numerical examples.},

  abstract = {The history of the development of statistical hypothesis testing in time series analysis
  is reviewed briefly and it is pointed out that the hypothesis testing procedure is not adequately
  defined as the procedure for statistical model identification. The classical maximum likelihood
  estimation procedure is reviewed and a new estimate minimum information theoretical criterion (AIC)
  estimate (MAICE) which is designed for the purpose of statistical identification is introduced. When
  there are several competing models the MAICE is defined by the model and the maximum likelihood
  estimates of the parameters which give the minimum of AIC defined by AIC = (-2)log-(maximum
  likelihood) + 2(number of independently adjusted parameters within the model). MAICE provides a
  versatile procedure for statistical model identification which is free from the ambiguities inherent
  in the application of conventional hypothesis testing procedure. The practical utility of MAICE in
  time series analysis is demonstrated with some numerical examples.},

@Inproceedings {export:80953,
abstract     = {<p>Data center infrastructures are highly underutilized on

                average. Typically, a data center manager computes the

                number of servers his facility can host by dividing the total

                power capacity of each rack by an assigned “peak power

                rating” for each server. However, this scheme suffers from

                the weakness of all static provisioning schemes – it does not

                account for the variability of load on the servers. We propose

                an algorithm that studies the power consumption behavior

                of the servers over time and suggests optimal ways

                to combine them in racks to maximize rack power utilization.

                Our algorithm – RackPacker – smooths aggregate rack

                power utilization by grouping together servers that are unlikely

                to peak together. Our evaluation of RackPacker on

                data from an MSN Messenger deployment shows substantially

                superior results than static packing.</p>},

    Abstract = {Sharing a MapReduce cluster between users is attractive because it enables statistical
    multiplexing (lowering costs) and allows users to share a common large data set. However, we find
    that traditional scheduling algorithms can perform very poorly in MapReduce due to two aspects of
    the MapReduce setting: the need for data locality (running computation where the data is) and the
    dependence between map and reduce tasks. We illustrate these problems through our experience
    designing a fair scheduler for MapReduce at Facebook, which runs a 600-node multi-user data
    warehouse on Hadoop. We developed two simple techniques, delay scheduling and copy-compute
    splitting, which improve throughput and response times by factors of 2 to 10. Although we focus on
    multi-user workloads, our techniques can also raise throughput in a single-user, FIFO workload by a
    factor of 2.}

    Abstract = {The past few years have seen a major change in computing systems, as growing data
    volumes and stalling processor speeds require more and more applications to scale out to distributed
    systems.  Today, a myriad data sources, from the Internet to business operations to scientific
    instruments, produce large and valuable data streams. However, the processing capabilities of single
    machines have not kept up with the size of data, making it harder and harder to put to use.  As a
    result, a growing number of organizations---not just web companies, but traditional enterprises and
    research labs---need to scale out their most important computations to clusters of hundreds of
    machines.

At the same time, the speed and sophistication required of data processing have grown.  In addition to
simple queries, complex algorithms like machine learning and graph analysis are becoming common in many
domains. And in addition to batch processing, streaming analysis of new real-time data sources is
required to let organizations take timely action.  Future computing platforms will need to not only
scale out traditional workloads, but support these new applications as well.

This dissertation proposes an architecture for cluster computing systems that can tackle emerging data
processing workloads while coping with larger and larger scales.  Whereas early cluster computing
systems, like MapReduce, handled batch processing, our architecture also enables streaming and
interactive queries, while keeping the scalability and fault tolerance of previous systems. And whereas
most deployed systems only support simple one-pass computations (e.g. aggregation or SQL queries), ours
also extends to the multi-pass algorithms required for more complex analytics (e.g. iterative algorithms
for machine learning).  Finally, unlike the specialized systems proposed for some of these workloads,
our architecture allows these computations to be combined, enabling rich new applications that intermix,
for example, streaming and batch processing, or SQL and complex analytics.

We achieve these results through a simple extension to MapReduce that adds primitives for data sharing,
called Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs).  We show that this is enough to efficiently capture a wide
range of workloads.  We implement RDDs in the open source Spark system, which we evaluate using both
synthetic benchmarks and real user applications.  Spark matches or exceeds the performance of
specialized systems in many application domains, while offering stronger fault tolerance guarantees and
allowing these workloads to be combined. We explore the generality of RDDs from both a theoretical
modeling perspective and a practical perspective to see why this extension can capture a wide range of
previously disparate workloads.}
